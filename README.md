Bulk Reputation Lookup

With Bulk Reputation Lookup, you can submit a list of suspicious IPs and initiate the analysis process. The tool then automatically queries the Virus Total and AbuseIPDB APIs to retrieve relevant data about each IP address's reputation and potential malicious activities.

The Virus Total API integration allows the tool to tap into a vast database of information, including data from numerous antivirus engines, URL scanners, and threat intelligence sources. It checks if the provided IPs have been reported as malicious, associated with malware, involved in phishing attempts, or any other suspicious activities that could endanger your network or systems.

Additionally, utilizes the AbuseIPDB API to assess the IPs against a community-driven database of abusive IP addresses. It examines whether the listed IPs have a history of engaging in malicious behavior, such as hacking attempts, brute-force attacks, or spamming activities.

The tool displays the results of the reputation analysis in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format. You can quickly identify the status of each IP address.
